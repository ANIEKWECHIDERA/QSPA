# This is QSPA!

it is the demo version of an examination platform I am working on.

The features currently include a timer which submits the exam when time is up.
It also shows the results at the end of the exam.

- Upcoming features:
- Ability to create an account.
- Back-end preview of student performance.
- Session persistency.
- Examination instructions.
- Summary of correct answers and wrong answers at the end of exam.
- Ability to download result as PDF.

Please note that this is a demo version and may not fully meet your needs. I recommend testing it in a local development environment before deploying it to production.
If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

About the code:
The code is written in JavaScript using React and TailwindCSS. It follows best practices for component organization, state management, and error handling.
To run the code locally, follow these steps:

   The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
